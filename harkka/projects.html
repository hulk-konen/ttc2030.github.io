<h3>Digitalized Coach</h3>
<h4>Aatos Health | CEO | 2019-</h4>
<p>
    Aatos is a digitalized wellbeing coach. At Aatos Health our mission is that our users live their lives according to their values. My most important contribution is to keep the north star clear on the team’s mind. The task may sound simple, but when possibilities are nearly endless, the need to focus raises.
</p>
<p>
    I have done hundreds of customer and user interviews at Aatos context. After several B2B pilots and a white label project, we pivoted to the B2C market and currently exploring that space.  We are Kiuas Start and Terkko Health Accelerator Alumni.

<h3>Real-Time Rock-Stress Monitoring System</h3>
<h4>Aalto University | Business Developer | 2020-2021</h4>
<p>
    Aalto University REMOS team was developing a real-time rock stress monitoring system for deep mines and took me into a wide-ranging role. This included for example assessing business potential, guiding product development with customer data, as well as a steering group and internal comms. 
</p>
<p>
    While our planned product had some initial traction, the sheer scope of the required R&D push forced me to give a pivot recommendation. The project continues currently as a spinoff company, AMS Solutions.

<h3>Online Exam Platform</h3>
<h4>Aalto University | Business Developer | 2019</h4>
<p>
    Aalto University ExamOS team had developed an online exam platform and took me in to assess business potential. While the product was very potential on the surface, after a multitude of customer interviews I had to give us a no-go recommendation, as the product was too off from what customers were seeking to purchase.

<h3>High Quality Coffee</h3>
<h4>Kirahvi Coffee Co | Entrepreneur | 2014-2019</h4>
<p>
    At Kirahvi Coffee Co the core of the business was always to procure, roast, and sell high-quality coffee. We did the last part in a variety of ways. In the B2C space, we developed several campaigns: Coffee bike courier (ordering through the digital channel), coffee bike (to serve coffee drinks), several pop-up cafes, street/festival/market/etc sales events, and webstore (several iterations, including digital marketing).
</p>
<p>
    I designed the product, improved it with customer feedback, managed the production, procurement, logistics, and sales with the help of a few-person team. Also, our social media accounts were updated by me. Whatever I do, I do it as digitally as possible. Our coffee was featured on a variety of media.

<h3>Factors Affecting Specialty Coffee Prices</h3>
<h4>Master's Thesis</h4>
<p>
    Auctions provide an interesting view into price formation. In some senses laws of supply and demand are in their purest form in the auction marketplaces.
</p>
<p>
    With various quality data, I analyzed 2105 green coffee lots sold through specialty coffee auctions. For example, growing altitude and variety were significant factors among over dozen other product attributes.  Analysis was done as a regression model, with truncated maximum likelihood estimation.
